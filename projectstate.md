Note: The project intentionally avoids TypeScript to maintain simplicity and reduce build complexity. Instead, we focus on clear code organization, comprehensive documentation, and thorough testing to ensure code quality. The project continues to maintain its focus on simplicity and performance while addressing core security and structural needs identified in the code review checklist.
