# Project State

PIM (Personal Information Manager) is designed to be a lightweight, fast, and efficient note-taking application. The focus is on simplicity and performance, using vanilla JavaScript without TypeScript or heavy frameworks. This approach ensures quick startup times and minimal resource usage.

## Important Notes

### Module Syntax Requirements

- Renderer process files (.js) use ES modules (import/export)
- Preload scripts (.js) must use CommonJS (require/module.exports)
- Main process files can use either syntax based on package.json "type"
- Incorrect syntax in preload scripts will break IPC communication

### Data Persistence

- Uses JsonDatabaseService for persistent storage
- Stores data in user's application data directory
- Supports CRUD operations for entries
- Supports multiple content types:
  - Note (default) - For general note-taking
  - Document - For formatted documents
  - Template - For reusable templates
  - HTML - For web content
  - Record - For structured data
  - Task - For actionable items
  - Event - For calendar events
- Only Note type entries are parsed for metadata
- Legacy entries without type are treated as Notes
- Handles image attachments with media directory
- Provides backup/restore functionality
- Uses atomic operations with rollback support
- Maintains proper timestamps for entries
- Supports batch operations
- Implements proper error handling

### Modal System

- Dynamic modal creation and removal
- Modals are created on-demand and removed from DOM when closed
- Supports custom content, buttons, and event handlers
- Consistent styling and behavior across all modals
- Built-in support for:
  - Settings configuration
  - Parser test results
  - Save As type selection
  - Custom modals for plugins
- Features:
  - Backdrop click to close
  - Keyboard escape to close
  - Custom width and height
  - Scrollable content
  - Primary/secondary button styles
  - SVG icon support
  - Proper z-index management
  - Background scroll prevention
  - Positioned modals for context-specific actions
  - Full viewport editor modal
  - Automatic scrollbars for overflow content

Note: The project intentionally avoids TypeScript to maintain simplicity and reduce build complexity. Instead, we focus on clear code organization through consistent module usage (ES modules for renderer process, CommonJS for preload scripts), comprehensive documentation, and thorough testing to ensure code quality. The project continues to maintain its focus on simplicity and performance while addressing core security and structural needs identified in the code review checklist.
