# Project State

PIM (Personal Information Manager) is designed to be a lightweight, fast, and efficient note-taking application. The focus is on simplicity and performance, using vanilla JavaScript without TypeScript or heavy frameworks. This approach ensures quick startup times and minimal resource usage.

## Documentation

## Important Notes

### Module Syntax Requirements
- Renderer process files (.js) use ES modules (import/export)
- Preload scripts (.js) must use CommonJS (require/module.exports)
- Main process files can use either syntax based on package.json "type"
- Incorrect syntax in preload scripts will break IPC communication

### Data Persistence
- Uses JsonDatabaseService for persistent storage
- Stores data in user's application data directory
- Supports CRUD operations for entries
- Handles image attachments with media directory
- Provides backup/restore functionality
- Uses atomic operations with rollback support
- Maintains proper timestamps for entries
- Supports batch operations
- Implements proper error handling

Note: The project intentionally avoids TypeScript to maintain simplicity and reduce build complexity. Instead, we focus on clear code organization, comprehensive documentation, and thorough testing to ensure code quality. The project continues to maintain its focus on simplicity and performance while addressing core security and structural needs identified in the code review checklist.
