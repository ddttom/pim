## Text Parsing

The application automatically extracts metadata from your text using various parsers. Each parser looks for specific patterns and returns structured data.

### Available Parsers

1. Action Parser
   - Matches: "todo", "task", "action", "do"
   - Example: "todo: Review document"

2. Attendees/Participants
   - Matches: "with: John, Mary" or "participants: Team Alpha"
   - Example: "Meeting with John, Mary and Team Alpha"

3. Categories & Tags
   - Matches: "category: Work" or "#project"
   - Example: "category: Personal #health #exercise"

4. Complexity & Priority
   - Matches: "complexity: high" or "priority: p1"
   - Example: "complexity: medium priority: high"

5. Contact Information
   - Matches: email addresses and phone numbers
   - Example: "contact: <john@example.com> (123) 456-7890"

6. Dates & Times
   - Matches: "due: tomorrow" or "at: 3pm"
   - Example: "due: next Friday at 2:30pm"

7. Dependencies
   - Matches: "depends on: #123" or "after: #456"
   - Example: "depends on: #123, #456"

8. Duration
   - Matches: "duration: 2h 30m" or "takes: 45m"
   - Example: "duration: 1h 30m"

9. Links
   - Matches: URLs and web references
   - Example: "see: <https://example.com>"

17. Urgency

### Parser Behavior

- Parsers silently handle errors and continue processing
- Failed matches return no results without affecting other parsers
- Debug logs are available for troubleshooting
- Multiple parsers can match in the same text
- Results are combined into structured metadata

### Examples

1. Meeting Entry:

   ```bash
   Team Sync Meeting
   with: John, Mary, Team Alpha
   at: Conference Room B
   time: 2pm
   duration: 1h
   recurring: weekly
   project: Website Redesign
   #meeting #sync
   ```

2. Task Entry:

   ```bash
   Review Documentation
   priority: high
   due: tomorrow at 5pm
   status: in progress
   depends on: #123
   project: Documentation
   remind: 1 hour before
   #docs #review
   ```

3. Contact Entry:

   ```bash
   John Smith Contact Info
   email: john@example.com
   phone: (123) 456-7890
   location: New York Office
   category: Business
   #contact
   ```
